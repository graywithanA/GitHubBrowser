A React Native app built while following the [Build iOS Apps with React Native](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/build-ios-apps-react-native) course on Pluralsight.

At the time I completed this course it was almost a year old and there have been some changes to React Native in that time.

 - React Native now depends on React so imports/requires are a bit different than in the course.
 - I've opted to use the ES6 `import` syntax instead of `require`.
 - I'm using a number of ES6 features that the author doesn't use.
   - Using arrow functions to declare class methods and avoid the need to use `.bind()`.
   - Using template literals instead of string concatination.
